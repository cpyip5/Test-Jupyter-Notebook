      "DESCRIPTION\n",
      "    keyboard\n",
      "    ========\n",
      "    \n",
      "    Take full control of your keyboard with this small Python library. Hook global events, register hotkeys, simulate key presses and much more.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    ## Features\n",
      "    \n",
      "    - **Global event hook** on all keyboards (captures keys regardless of focus).\n",
      "    - **Listen** and **send** keyboard events.\n",
      "    - Works with **Windows** and **Linux** (requires sudo), with experimental **OS X** support (thanks @glitchassassin!).\n",
      "    - **Pure Python**, no C modules to be compiled.\n",
      "    - **Zero dependencies**. Trivial to install and deploy, just copy the files.\n",
      "    - **Python 2 and 3**.\n",
      "    - Complex hotkey support (e.g. `ctrl+shift+m, ctrl+space`) with controllable timeout.\n",
      "    - Includes **high level API** (e.g. [record](#keyboard.record) and [play](#keyboard.play), [add_abbreviation](#keyboard.add_abbreviation)).\n",
      "    - Maps keys as they actually are in your layout, with **full internationalization support** (e.g. `Ctrl+ç`).\n",
      "    - Events automatically captured in separate thread, doesn't block main program.\n",
      "    - Tested and documented.\n",
      "    - Doesn't break accented dead keys (I'm looking at you, pyHook).\n",
      "    - Mouse support available via project [mouse](https://github.com/boppreh/mouse) (`pip install mouse`).\n",
      "    \n",
      "    ## Usage\n",
      "    \n",
      "    Install the [PyPI package](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/keyboard/):\n",
      "    \n",
      "        pip install keyboard\n",
      "    \n",
      "    or clone the repository (no installation required, source files are sufficient):\n",
      "    \n",
      "        git clone https://github.com/boppreh/keyboard\n",
      "    \n",
      "    or [download and extract the zip](https://github.com/boppreh/keyboard/archive/master.zip) into your project folder.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    Then check the [API docs below](https://github.com/boppreh/keyboard#api) to see what features are available.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    \n",
      "    ## Example\n",
      "    \n",
      "    \n",
      "    ```py\n",
      "    import keyboard\n",
      "    \n",
      "    keyboard.press_and_release('shift+s, space')\n",
      "    \n",
      "    keyboard.write('The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.')\n",
      "    \n",
      "    keyboard.add_hotkey('ctrl+shift+a', print, args=('triggered', 'hotkey'))\n",
      "    \n",
      "    # Press PAGE UP then PAGE DOWN to type \"foobar\".\n",
      "    keyboard.add_hotkey('page up, page down', lambda: keyboard.write('foobar'))\n",
      "    \n",
      "    # Blocks until you press esc.\n",
      "    keyboard.wait('esc')\n",
      "    \n",
      "    # Record events until 'esc' is pressed.\n",
      "    recorded = keyboard.record(until='esc')\n",
      "    # Then replay back at three times the speed.\n",
      "    keyboard.play(recorded, speed_factor=3)\n",
      "    \n",
      "    # Type @@ then press space to replace with abbreviation.\n",
      "    keyboard.add_abbreviation('@@', 'my.long.email@example.com')\n",
      "    \n",
      "    # Block forever, like `while True`.\n",
      "    keyboard.wait()\n",
      "    ```\n",
      "    \n",
      "    ## Known limitations:\n",
      "    \n",
      "    - Events generated under Windows don't report device id (`event.device == None`). [#21](https://github.com/boppreh/keyboard/issues/21)\n",
      "    - Media keys on Linux may appear nameless (scan-code only) or not at all. [#20](https://github.com/boppreh/keyboard/issues/20)\n",
      "    - Key suppression/blocking only available on Windows. [#22](https://github.com/boppreh/keyboard/issues/22)\n",
      "    - To avoid depending on X, the Linux parts reads raw device files (`/dev/input/input*`)\n",
      "    but this requires root.\n",
      "    - Other applications, such as some games, may register hooks that swallow all \n",
      "    key events. In this case `keyboard` will be unable to report events.\n",
      "    - This program makes no attempt to hide itself, so don't use it for keyloggers or online gaming bots. Be responsible.\n",
